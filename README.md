- **ESLint / Prettier** 🧑‍🔧 - Code linting and formatting tools to maintain quality and consistency

## React.js Advanced Concepts 🧠
Here’s an overview of the **advanced React concepts** I have explored and continue to refine as I deepen my understanding:

### 1. **React Hooks** 🔑:
   - **useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer**: Leveraging hooks for state and side-effect management.
   - **Custom Hooks** 🔄: Creating reusable logic across components to avoid duplication.
   - **useMemo and useCallback** ⚡: Optimizing performance by memoizing values and functions.
   - **useLayoutEffect vs useEffect** 🔄: Understanding the difference and appropriate use cases for both.

### 2. **Component Architecture** 🏗️:
   - **Functional Components vs Class Components** 🔄: Benefits of functional components with hooks.
   - **Smart vs Dumb Components** 🧠: Separation of concerns for better maintainability.
   - **Container/Presentational Pattern** 🧱: Organizing components into container and presentational layers.

### 3. **State Management** 🏷️:
   - **React Context API** 🌍: Managing state at a global level without prop-drilling.
   - **Redux** 🔄: Advanced state management with actions, reducers, and middleware (Thunk/Saga).
   - **Redux Toolkit** 🛠️: Simplifying Redux development with Redux Toolkit and Redux DevTools.
   - **React Query** 🌐: Fetching, caching, and syncing server data with React components.

### 4. **React Router** 🛣️:
   - **Dynamic Routing** 🌍: Creating dynamic routes with parameters and query strings.
   - **Nested Routing** 🔄: Building nested routes and layouts.
   - **Programmatic Navigation** 🧭: Using `useNavigate` and `useHistory` for navigation control.
   - **Protected Routes** 🔐: Implementing authentication and authorization guards.

### 5. **Performance Optimization** ⚡:
   - **Code Splitting** 💣: Lazy loading components and routes to reduce the initial bundle size.
   - **React.memo and PureComponent** 🚀: Preventing unnecessary re-renders to optimize performance.
   - **useEffect cleanup** 🧹: Avoiding memory leaks with clean-up logic in `useEffect`.
   - **Virtualization** 🖥️: Using libraries like `react-window` and `react-virtualized` to render large lists efficiently.

### 6. **Error Boundaries** ❌:
   - Handling JavaScript errors in UI components with error boundaries.
   - Graceful degradation and user-friendly error messages in production.

### 7. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG)** 🌐:
   - Working with **Next.js** for server-side rendering and static site generation.
   - Understanding hydration and its impact on SSR.
   - Using **getServerSideProps** and **getStaticProps** for fetching data during SSR/SSG.

### 8. **Testing React Components** 🧪:
   - **Unit Testing** 🧑‍🔬: Writing unit tests for components, reducers, and actions with **Jest**.
   - **Integration Testing** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑: Testing component interaction and data flow with **React Testing Library**.
   - **Mocking** 🛠️: Using mocking techniques for external services like APIs.

### 9. **Form Management** 📝:
   - **Formik** and **React Hook Form** 🧳: Simplified form handling, validation, and submission.
   - **Validation with Yup** ✔️: Integrating **Yup** schema validation for form fields.
   - **Custom Input Components** 🧑‍🔧: Building custom input components for reusable form fields.

### 10. **Building Scalable Applications** 📈:
   - **Modular Component Design** 🧩: Designing components to be reusable, testable, and maintainable.
   - **Atomic Design** 🧪: Breaking down UI into smaller components and following Atomic Design principles.
   - **Component Libraries** 📚: Integrating third-party UI component libraries like Material UI and Ant Design.

## Features & Best Practices 💡
- **Component Reusability** 🔄: Building components that can be reused throughout your application for consistency and maintainability.
- **Declarative UI** 🖋️: Using JSX and React’s declarative style to describe the UI in an intuitive way.
- **Separation of Concerns** 🛠️: Keeping logic separate from UI components for cleaner and more maintainable code.
- **Atomic Design** ⚙️: Structuring UI components from atoms (smallest building blocks) to molecules (composed components).
- **Code Consistency** 🔄: Using ESLint and Prettier to ensure consistent code formatting and quality.

## Code Organization & Structure 📁
- **Folder Structure** 🏗️: Organizing React app folders into components, hooks, services, utils, etc.
- **Naming Conventions** ✍️: Following naming conventions to keep code easily understandable and maintainable.
- **Modularization** 🔧: Dividing complex logic into smaller, manageable modules.
